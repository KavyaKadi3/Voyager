# Voyager
*Plan Today, Deliver Tomorrow*

Voyager is an easy-to-use, efficient trip-planning navigational tool (Geographic Information System) dedicated to helping small business owners plan, schedule, and optimize their delivery routes.

Many businesses that operate on a smaller scale (teams under 10 employees) often have to make their own product deliveries. Finding an ideal path to take between different delivery stops can be challenging. This process is made easy with Voyager.

Here is how to navigate Voyager's simple graphical interface:

## Help Button
Voyager displays a help button at the bottom right of the user interface. Clicking on this button displays a descriptive and clear message that allows its users to gain a complete understanding of the map and its features. Users can utilize this button to get an initial awareness of how Voyager works and can rely on it at any point of uncertainty or confusion using the software.

## Error/Instruction Messages
Any time a feature is utilized in Voyager, an instruction box will appear so that the user can understand how to apply it optimally. This instruction message appears when the Path Find: Click button is selected.

When the program is used incorrectly (e.g. user enters invalid input into search bar), Voyager provides helpful messages to provide insight on what was done inaccurately.

## Dark Mode
Dark Mode displays the map with certain colours to emit lower illuminance , keeping the user's visual fatigue to a minimum. The option can be easily enabled by clicking on the “Dark Mode” button on the upper right corner of the user interface. Reactivating “Light Mode” can be done by clicking on the button again.

## Zoom to Intersection + Point of Intersection Pop-up box

Voyager lets users find points of interest (POIs) nearby any location through the orange circles. Users can press the “Zoom to Intersection” button to view their wanted location closer on the map, and the POIs nearby.

When a user clicks on any of the orange circles (POIs), it lets users know the closest intersection to it and the type of point of interest it is (e.g. coffee shops).
